<!-- Activity
Add CSS to all HTML pages you have created so far.
You must include at least a class and an id.
There is much, much more that you can do with CSS.
These are the basics. You can research more to get
your website exactly as you like it.  -->

<!-- What about layout, positioning
and arranging things?
We will use CSS Flexbox tomorrow. Itâ€™s much easier to
use for centring, alignment and position of items (we
also use it to make really nice navbars). So wait!  -->
