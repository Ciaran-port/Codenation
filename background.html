    <p class="background">My whole career i have been a chef, i started when i was 15 . <br> I enjoyed the job over the years. It taught me alot of skills which are transferable to many areas in my life. <br> not only did i learn the obvious... how to cook but it also taught me things like project management, <br> organisation and how to work under preassure and to a deadline. I am a hard working and determined individual,<br>if i dont know something i am not afraid to ask. </p>
