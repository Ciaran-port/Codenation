        <p class="aboutMe">My name is Ciaran, When i was younger I played rugby for Kent, but as i got into my career of being a chef i didnt have the time to continue with it. <br>I have always been an avid gamer and recently i have picked up axe throwing as a hobby as well.
            <br>i have spent the last 20+ years working as a chef but feel due to the current climate it is time to make a change so i enrolled in a coding course with CodeNation in an effort to start my potential career in IT</p>
